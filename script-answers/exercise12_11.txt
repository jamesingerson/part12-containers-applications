Go to the Redis container with docker exec and open the redis-cli.
docker container ls
docker exec -lt todo-backend-redis-1 bash
redis-cli

Find the key you used with KEYS *
127.0.0.1:6379> KEYS *
1) "added_todos"

Check the value of the key with command GET
127.0.0.1:6379> GET added_todos
"13"

Set the value of the counter to 9001, find the right command from https://redis.io/commands/
127.0.0.1:6379> SET added_todos 9001
OK

Make sure that the new value works by refreshing the page http://localhost:3000/statistics
âœ“

Create a new todo with Postman and ensure from redis-cli that the counter has increased accordingly
127.0.0.1:6379> GET added_todos
"9002"

Delete the key from cli and ensure that counter works when new todos are added
127.0.0.1:6379> DEL added_todos
(integer) 1
127.0.0.1:6379> GET added_todos
(nil)

refreshed http://localhost:3000/statistics, returned added_todos	"0"
added a new todo via Postman, http://localhost:3000/statistics returned added_todos	"1"
